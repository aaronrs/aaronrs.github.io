**Identity map **

When I was making my identity map I really wasn't sure what and how much information to put on it and made slow progress on it.
I found it quite fun to make the identity map and it was interesting.
I felt excited showing my work to the rest of the class and hear their views.

When I was judging the identity maps I felt as if I had to mark each differently even though they were alike.
I preferred this way to face to face answers.
When I read through the comments I expected all of them so it wasn’t a surprise.
When I got them back I was fine with them.

When commenting online it is very different because people write more freely as the person they are commenting on is far away.

This work did not affect my opinion on what to post and what not to.
This did not change my view of media either.
The six lessons have affected how I see media but only a little.
The lessons though didn’t affect my plan to use social media.
