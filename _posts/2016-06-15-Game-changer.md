**Game changer**

Today we started coding our games. I started straight away as I had a clear thought track of what I was going to do. I started by making it say EVADER which is the name of my game and then tell you what the instructions were. Then I created a falling temple scene and capped it off with a countdown. But, I decided to save the game code early just in case and that was my downfall. I highlighted all the raw code and was about to copy when I accidentally pressed enter. All my code went! The lesson was for nothing.
