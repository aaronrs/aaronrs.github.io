**My ****most unusual**** IT lesson**

We walked into the classroom, logged on to our computers and moved our chairs and sat down around Mr Keen.  We started talking about IT but then, somehow, we began to talk about black holes. Then we talked about things in this order: white holes, hackers, time and space, height, life, conspiracy theories and finally [ILLUMINATI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati)! Mr Keen said that if illuminati exists then he is one of them. While having this conversation Ollie searched up illuminati on the web and clicked on a website. When he did so the school had a power cut. So for the rest of the lesson we did binary and hex numbers. That was how my lesson went. 1 Hour of my **LIFE!**
