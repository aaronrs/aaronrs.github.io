**Our Game**

Today we created the plans for our games. Most people teamed up in 2s and started planning. There was a checksheet so we knew what to include and we were told to make our games as original as possible, even though most peoples were the same. My plan is to make a game where you have to dodge the falling debris and complete 3 levels including a boss battles. There will be minigames and points are scored by getting coins. I can't wait until we actually make them.
