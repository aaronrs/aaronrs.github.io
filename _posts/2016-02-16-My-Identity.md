**My Identity???**

We started the lesson with logging onto our computers and going to the front of the classroom.

We looked at everyone's homework  and everyone who hasn't done their homework.

There were many of both! I of course had done it. We judged the homework and mine was good. Then we started on the new work, our Identity! We have to put pictures or anything really on it that show who I am.
