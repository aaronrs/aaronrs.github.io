**The good and bad scale**

In the lesson we got given 12 peices of paper with things like 'you showed a picture of your cat' or ‘you told people that you were on holiday and the house was empty’.

Then we had to put them in a line in the order from worst thing to do to something that doesn't matter!

We learnt about what to do and different perspectives in different situations!
