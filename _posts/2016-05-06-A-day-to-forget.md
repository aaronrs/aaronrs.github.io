**A day to forget**

Today we did some of the other microbit tutorial. They included the dice roll, the mood swing, flashpoint and the worst snake ever. At the end of the lessen when I had done 3 of them someone asked the teacher if they had to be saved and he replied yes. I froze! I had not saved any of them and so all my work was for nothing!:(

He then set our homework as 30-40 mins of work. Doing the TUTORIALS. The ones that I had done but not saved. At least I could save part of the 4th one. But I wasn't the only one not to save them so that was OK.
