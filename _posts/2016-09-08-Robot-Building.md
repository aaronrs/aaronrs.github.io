    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started by going on classroom and getting pieces of fuze.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a Fuze and read about it in a booklet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, we got our Fuze to work but then the items on the screen went huge and unreadable.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There weren't any strategies apart from trial and error as we just collected and put it together. Also the only hold ups were getting it plugged in and the mouse broke.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Things that limited my learning mostly only delayed me and they were my inexperience of using an ipad and my head being too big to properly see under the computer screen and plug stuff in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As we only plugged things in this lesson I do not think that I need to change anything as I didnâ€™t do anything wrong.</td>
