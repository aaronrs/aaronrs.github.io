**Prezi and Faults**

Today we looked at someone's prezi project and talked about it's faults. The faults included clear copying from the web, bad spelling, too much writing and a layout. We then had to pair up with 1 other person and judge each others blogs. I paired up with Seth and got to look at his blog. His wasn’t working so I couldn’t read his blogs. I had to give him a very low score but I tried to be nice as I could. He gave me and this blog an overall rating of AWESOME which was the highest rating there was. He really liked the colour scheme and the context but he did put my amount of blogs as good not awesome. Sorry for not posting too often. After that we talked about faults again. How some people don’t put enough effort in. Then he set us this homework and the bell went.

Here is a link to my prezi project-> /prezi.com/s2ozxgbbahb0/the-history-of-computers/
