**SexEd?**



Today in IT we talked about the homework which was about revenge porn and sexting. We talked about our findings and how over half of teenage boys and girls have received sexts. We then went  to talk about other words and talk about stories and experiences. But the lesson passed quickly and we finished IT for the year.
