    <td>I learnt by following the instructions and doing what they wanted me to do. The best strategy for me was just trying what you think will work and if it doesn't work, just change what looks odd.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were that I was helping the people next to me as they kept on getting stuck and how when I finished one of the quizzes it skipped a course. I donâ€™t think that there were any habits that I needed to improve.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to point my neighbors the right way more, rather than just telling them the answer and I will improve my learning by reading all of the instructions.</td>
