  <tr>
    <td>I learned by writing and reading from the booklet and discussing with my partner. We discussed and debated about what went wrong when the programmed faulted  and we guessed what the program was going to show after coding. I think that this discussing was the most helpful part.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were our dodgy cable which delayed minutes as it kept on falling out of place. Also when we went on to the electronics we placed it out as we thought it showed on the booklet but it was not clear so it took several attempts. And even when we managed it and typed in the code it didn't work and we kept on having to re-open the programming software as it froze every time we ran it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson I think that I will try and ask what the other groups around we tried and did to make it work and learn from them. I think that it will help my learning as I wonâ€™t be stuck on things for so long and will be able to view things from other people's perspectives.</td>
