  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how some circuits need resistors for to complete them and that the red and blue wires are different sizes. I found changing the LED's should be the first thing to re-check as so many of them are broken.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were most of the lights were broken; the images were confusing and neither me or my partner really knew what to do. I think that I need to work on finding out the problem quicker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to work out if the program or the placement of circuit parts is the problem when our light shows fails. I will try and find the most likely causes first and work from then on.</td>
