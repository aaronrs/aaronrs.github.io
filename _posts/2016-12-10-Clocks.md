  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that some simple, tiny component can detect light and change that into a number or circle size. Today, as not everything went to plan, the best strategy was to change everything one at a time to try and find the problem.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were our dodgy cable which delayed minutes as it kept on falling out of place but more than usual. Also our circuit with light detector wasn't working when we added an LED. I think that I need to work on reading more of the booklet as I do skip parts.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try the light detector, LED mix once again and if it doesnâ€™t talk to a teacher straight away and not waste time. Reading more will definitely improve my learning and I could also help my partner code.</td>
