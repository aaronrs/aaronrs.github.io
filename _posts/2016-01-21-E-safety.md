**E-safety**

In our lesson we talked about E-safety and opinions.

We talked about what info you should put on profiles or texts and what not to.

We also were asked to walk to different sides of the room if we agreed or didn't agree with certain questions such as reality tv is truthful.

Which it isn't.

**Top Tips**

**Don't say where you live, your full name, your phone number or when youâ€™re going on holiday!**

**Be safe Children(and adults).**
