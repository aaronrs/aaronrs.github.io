**Microbits!**

Today we got our Microbits. We lined up and received the batteries, the battery container, the microbit and the usb cable. We then learnt how compile, download and then program the Microbits and get them working. But that was only half of the lesson. The last half of the lesson was to do with what social media is useful for and then porn and sexting. We heard about what online things people were scared of such as hacking, pedos and grooming. We then went on to talking about revenge porn and then bad things happened. Homework happened. We have to research articles about sexting and revenge porn. I will be deleting some search history!
