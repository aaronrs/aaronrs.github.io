  <tr>
    <td>I learned by when making mistakes re-reading the instructions and checking for spelling errors. We found out that the pictures of the set outs of wires is different on their FUZE to ours so we had to adjust to that. I found that a helpful strategy with the lights was to try and copy from the picture but use common sense to where to put them.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were our dodgy cable which delayed minutes as it kept on falling out of place at the start of the lesson. Also as the picture of their circuit was different it took multiple attempts to figure out. I think that I need to work on putting the wires in straight as I think I bent some of them by pushing down too hard.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to get me and my partner's time on coding and placement right to maximise efficiency. I will also try to read more of the side writing to help me learn more and understand more about the subject.</td>
