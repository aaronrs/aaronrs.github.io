**Media**

On the 13th of January 2016 I had an IT lesson.

In this particular lesson we talked about media and lies!

We were asked to ask other people in the class some questions about them like 'Can you access media whenever you want?'

This is not true to anyone but it was not thought about so people said yes.

Our teacher made us do this to show us what people are like.

Then our teacher talked to us about advertising.

He showed us an ad with hamsters and cars and we talked about the aspects of it.

It was more complex than we thought
