  <tr>
    <td>Throughout the lesson we looked at people's blogs and discussed what was wrong with them and what was good about them. We compared great ones with terrible ones. I think that I found the better ones more helpful as it showed me what things I should be doing rather than what things I have already done. Also it gave me design ideas. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the only two things that limited my learning were the fact that my blog wasn't shown, as we would have gone more in depth into it as a group, and me not asking questions, as that would have helped me expand my knowledge in my weakest points.I think I need to work on asking more questions to help me on my blog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As this lesson was an only questioning based lesson I only think if we did this again to make more questions, but for using Fuze I must work on my partner work and maximising the work we get through in the time as I think we go a bit slow.</td>
