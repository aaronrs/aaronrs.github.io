    <td>I learned about how to code the computer to think of a number between certain numbers and then give us a multiple number of chances to guess it. We also had to make it so that it told us if we were too high or too low. When the code didn't work the best strategy was too slowly and meticulously look over the code and especially watch out for capitals.</td>
